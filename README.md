Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

> Trend, trait, and feature distribution analysis.
> 
> Customer personas and potential engagement channels.

2. Feature Engineering:
Techniques like binning and categorical encoding.

3. Feature Selection:
Insights from EDA and statistical methods (e.g., mutual_info_classif).

4. Imbalance Handling:
Oversampling using SMOTE and ADASYN.

5. Model Development and Evaluation:
Algorithm selection and optimization.
 
6. Metrics: PR AUC, F1 score, precision, recall (emphasizing false negatives).

7. Feature Importance and Prediction:
Identifying key predictors for better targeting.
